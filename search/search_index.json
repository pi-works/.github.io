When the bearing of the target MAV can be measured by onboard visual sensors of the pursuer MAV, the problem becomes three-dimensional (3D) bearing-only target following, which has been rarely studied in the literature and faces some unique challenges. To solve this problem, we propose a series of novel results on target estimation, observability analysis, and observability enhancement. The novelty of the results is summarized as follows.</p> <p>First, in order to estimate the motion of the target MAV from 3D bearing measurements, we propose a new pseudo-linear Kalman filter, which has a concise expression yet superior stability properties compared to the classic ones including the conventional extended Kalman filter and modified polar coordinate filter. </p> <p>Second, we propose a novel approach to analyze the observability of state estimate of the target when only bearing information is available. While the existing ones by optimizing the determinant of Fisher information matrix are applicable to 2D single-step horizon cases, our approach can handle more general 3D multiple-step horizon cases.</p> <p>Third, based on the theoretical conclusion of our observability analysis, we design a new 3D helical guidance law that can better exploit the additional degree of freedom in 3D. The guidance law is adapted to quadcopter's dynamics and a low-level flight controller is designed based on geometric control.</p> <p>Extensive numerical simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art ones.

Here, \\(x_P\\) is known and \\(x_T\\) is to be estimated. The discrete double-integrator dynamics of the states are described by $$     x_{T,k} = Ax_{T,k-1} + Bq_k $$ $$     x_{P,k} = Ax_{P,k-1} + Bu_k $$</p> <p>where $$ A = \\begin{bmatrix}     I_{3\\times 3} &amp; \\Delta tI_{3\\times 3} \\     0_{3\\times 3} &amp; I_{3\\times 3} \\end{bmatrix}, $$ $$ B = \\begin{bmatrix}     \\frac{1}{2}\\Delta t^2 I_{3\\times 3} \\     \\Delta t I_{3\\times 3} \\end{bmatrix}, $$</p> <p>and \\(\\Delta t\\) is the sampling time. Here, \\(u_k\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is the control input of the pursuer, \\(q_k\\) is a process noise drawn from a zero-mean normal distribution, that is,\\(q_k \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,Q_k)\\) where we assume the acceleration of the target is unknown.</p> <p>Subtracting the above two equations leads to the dynamical equation of the relative state \\(x=x_T-x_P\\): $$ x_k = Ax_{k-1} - Bu_k + Bq_k. $$ The term \\(Bu_k\\) could be calculated by \\(Bu_k=x_{P,k}-Ax_{P,k-1}\\).</p> Measurement Equation <p>While \\(p\\) and \\(p_T\\) are the position of the pursuer and target MAVs, respectively, we know that $$ \\lambda = \\frac{p_T - p}{||p_T - p||}  $$ is a unit vector representing the relative bearing of the target with respect to the pursuer. In our work, we use the unit vector instead of angles to represent 3D bearings to avoid complicated trigonometric functions.</p> <p>In practice, we are only able to obtain a noise-corrupted bearing, denoted as \\(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\): $$ \\tilde{\\lambda} = \\lambda + \\nu $$ where \\(\\nu \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\) is the measurement noise assumed to be normally distributed: \\(\\nu \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\Sigma), \\Sigma = \\sigma^2 I_{3\\times 3}\\).</p> <p>It is noticed that \\(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\) is a nonlinear function of \\(p_T\\). In order to obtain a linear measurement equation, we introduce an orthogonal projection operator. For any nonzero vector \\(g\\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\), define $$ P_g = I_{3\\times3} - \\frac{g}{|g|}\\frac{g^T}{|g|} $$ The interpretation of \\(P_g\\) is that, for any vector \\(z \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\), its orthogonal projection onto the plane perpendicular to \\(g\\) is \\(P_g z\\). The matrix \\(P_g\\) satisfies \\(P_g=P_g^T\\), \\(P_g^2 = P_g\\) and \\(\\text{ker}(P_g) = \\text{span}(g)\\).</p> <p>Multiplying \\(rP_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\) on both sides of  \\(\\tilde{\\lambda} = \\lambda + \\nu\\) gives $$ 0_{3\\times 1} = P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}(p_T-p) + rP_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\nu $$ where \\(r=||p_T-p||\\) and the left-hand side is zero because \\(P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\tilde{\\lambda} = 0\\). Thus, the nonlinear bearing function becomes a pseudo-linear equation. Furthermore, since the relative state to be estimated is \\(x:=[(p-p_T)^T,  (v-v_T)^T]^T\\in\\mathbb{R}^6\\), the final measurement equation is obtained as $$ 0_{3\\times 1} = \\begin{bmatrix}     P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}} &amp;  0_{3\\times 3} \\end{bmatrix} x + rP_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\nu. $$ Note \\(\\nu\\) is assumed to be normally distributed and the term \\(rP_{\\tilde{\\lambda}}\\) can be considered as a time-varying noise transition matrix. By inspection we can conclude this transition depends on the true range \\(r\\) and the orientation of the vector \\(\\tilde{\\lambda}\\). One problem for estimating the noise transition matrix is that the true range \\(r\\) is not known in practice, so in the filter we replace \\(r\\) with a predicted one. Such replacement has been used in other research works and verified to be effective in our simulation and experimental results. </p> Overall u-PLKF <p>The steps of the proposed 3D bearing-only uniform pseudo-linear Kalman filter (u-PLKF) is summarized below. </p> <p>The prediction step is</p> \\[ \\hat{x}_k^- = A(\\hat{x}_{k-1} + x_{P,k-1}) - x_{P,k} \\] <p>$$ P_k^- = AP_{k-1}A^T + BQ_kB^T $$ where \\(\\hat{x}_k^-\\) and \\(P_k^-\\) are the priori state estimate and error covariance. </p> <p>The correction step is $$ K_k = P_k^-H_k^T(H_kP_k^-H_k^T+V_k\\Sigma V_k^T)^{\\dagger} $$</p> \\[ \\hat{x}_k = \\hat{x}_k^- -K_kH_k\\hat{x}_k^-  \\] \\[ P_k = (I_{6\\times 6}-K_kH_k)P_k^- \\] <p>where \\(H_k = \\begin{bmatrix} P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}_k} &amp;  0_{3\\times 3} \\end{bmatrix}\\), \\(K_k\\) is the observer gain, \\(V_k = \\hat{r}_k^-P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}_k}\\) and \\(\\hat{r}_k^-\\) is simply the norm of the first three components of \\(\\hat{x}_k^-\\),\\(\\hat{x}_k\\) and \\(P_k\\) are the posterior state estimate and error covariance, and symbol \\(\\dagger\\) denotes the pseudo-inverse. The reason for using pseudo-inverse is that the matrix \\((H_kP_k^-H_k^T+V_k\\Sigma V_k^T)\\) is rank deficient since \\(P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}_k}\\) in \\(H_k\\) is rank deficient. The usage of pseudo-inverse in the Kalman filter is a common practice when the inverse does not exist.</p> <p>Denote \\(z_k\\) as the measurement in a classic Kalman filter. According to the measurement equation, it is noticeable that in our model \\(z_k\\) is actually \\(0_{3\\times 1}\\). With \\(z_k=0_{3\\times 1}\\), the standard step of updating the posterior estimate \\(\\hat{x}_k\\) is thus reduced as follows: $$ \\hat{x}_k = \\hat{x}_k^- +K_k(z_k - H_k\\hat{x}_k^- ) = \\hat{x}_k^- -K_kH_k\\hat{x}_k^-. $$</p> <p>Actually, the measurement information has been implicitly contained in matrix \\(H_k\\), and this is also where the name pseudo-linear comes from because \\(H_k\\) is varying. In addition, the observation matrix \\(H_k\\) has the same mathematical expression in both 2D and 3D cases. Particularly, \\(H_k\\) can be written as \\(H_k = \\begin{bmatrix} P_{\\tilde{\\lambda}_k} &amp; 0_{d\\times d} \\end{bmatrix}\\) where \\(\\tilde{\\lambda} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d\\) and \\(d\\) is space dimension which can be \\(2\\) or \\(3\\). By contrast, the observation matrices for common EKF methods have more complicated expressions when dimension is lifted from 2 to 3. This is how the name uniform PLKF, or u-PLKF is coined as.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Use this concise result in your Kalman filter design !
