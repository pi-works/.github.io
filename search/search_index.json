When the bearing of the target MAV can be measured by onboard visual sensors of the pursuer MAV, the problem becomes three-dimensional (3D) bearing-only target following, which has been rarely studied in the literature and faces some unique challenges. To solve this problem, we propose a series of novel results on target estimation, observability analysis, and observability enhancement. The novelty of the results is summarized as follows.</p> <p>First, in order to estimate the motion of the target MAV from 3D bearing measurements, we propose a new pseudo-linear Kalman filter, which has a concise expression yet superior stability properties compared to the classic ones including the conventional extended Kalman filter and modified polar coordinate filter. </p> <p>Second, we propose a novel approach to analyze the observability of state estimate of the target when only bearing information is available. While the existing ones by optimizing the determinant of Fisher information matrix are applicable to 2D single-step horizon cases, our approach can handle more general 3D multiple-step horizon cases.</p> <p>Third, based on the theoretical conclusion of our observability analysis, we design a new 3D helical guidance law that can better exploit the additional degree of freedom in 3D. The guidance law is adapted to quadcopter's dynamics and a low-level flight controller is designed based on geometric control.</p> <p>Extensive numerical simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art ones. Flight experiments on real quadrotor platforms further show the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithms in practice.</p> <p>The paper is available here.</p>"},{"location":"Image-Based%20Visual%20Servoing/","title":"Image-Based Visual Servoing of Rotorcrafts to Planar Visual Targets of Arbitrary Orientation","text":"<p>If the video fails to load, consider using a network proxy or visiting this page.</p> <p>This letter for the first time extends the virtual camera image-based visual servoing (IBVS) scheme to enable an underactuated rotorcraft UAV to regulate its translational motion and heading relative to a planar visual target of arbitrary orientation. The conversion from real camera images to virtual camera images of visual targets are proposed based on a set of rotation matrices. Hence, image moment features can be reused due to the simplicity and decoupled structure of the interaction matrix, and satisfactory 3D Cartesian trajectory of UAVs. </p> <p>In the design of the IBVS control law, the external disturbance and model uncertainties are estimated by an integral-based filter. In addition, to enable tracking of a moving visual target, a velocity estimator is developed. The global asymptotic stability of the error dynamics is proven. Both of the simulation and experimental results of tracking of a tilted moving planar target are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed IBVS scheme.  </p> <p>The paper is available here.</p>"},{"location":"Nonlinear%20Trajectory%20Tracking/","title":"A Nonlinear Trajectory Tracking Controller for Helicopters: Design and Experimental Evaluation","text":"<p>If the video fails to load, consider using a network proxy or visiting this page.</p> <p>This paper addresses the design and experimental evaluation of a controller to steer a helicopter along a desired trajectory. The controller is designed based on Lyapunov\u2019s method and backstepping technique. Control laws for thrust and angular velocity are presented that guarantee the convergence of the trajectory tracking error to zero for a simplified helicopter model.

The control law enables a RUAV with a minimal set of sensors, i.e. an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a single downward facing camera, to regulate its position and heading relative to a planar visual target consisting of multiple points. </p> <p>As compared to our previous work, twofold improvement is made. First, the desired value of the image feature of controlling the vertical motion of the RUAV is a function of other image features instead of a constant. This modification helps to keep the visual target stay in the camera\u2019s field of view by indirectly adjusting the height of the vehicle. Second, the proposed approach simplifies our previous output feedback law by reducing the dimension of the observer filter state space while the same asymptotic stability result is kept.

Traditional agent-based models often rely on static rules that fail to capture the dynamic strategies of the biological world. Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a solution, but most previous methods adopt handcrafted reward functions that implicitly or explicitly encourage the emergence of swarming behaviors. </p> <p>In this study, we propose a minimal predator-prey coevolution framework based on mixed cooperative-competitive multiagent reinforcement learning, and adopt a reward function that is solely based on the fundamental survival pressure, that is, prey receive a reward of -1 if caught by predators while predators receive a reward of +1. Surprisingly, our analysis of this approach reveals an unexpectedly rich diversity of emergent behaviors for both prey and predators, including flocking and swirling behaviors for prey, as well as dispersion tactics, confusion, and marginal predation phenomena for predators. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the collective behavior of organisms and highlights the potential applications in swarm robotics.  </p> <p>The paper is available here.</p>"}]}
